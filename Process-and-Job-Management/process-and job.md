  ## Job and Process control in linux

  ### Job and Process in Layman terms
**Process (in simple terms)** \
**A process** is just something your computer is doing right now. \
Example:
- When you open Chrome, your computer starts a process for Chrome.
- When you run ls in the terminal, that‚Äôs a tiny process.
  
-Every process has a name (what it‚Äôs doing) and a PID (its ID so the system can keep track).
_Think of it like a worker in a factory: each worker (process) is assigned a task._

**A job** is a process that your terminal knows about.
Example:
- If you run a program normally, it‚Äôs a foreground job (it blocks the terminal until it finishes).
- If you add & at the end, it runs in the background, so your terminal is free while it keeps running.
  
Think of it like:
- You ask a worker to do a task in front of you (foreground job).
- Or you send a worker to do a task in another room and keep working yourself (background job).
Key idea

- Process = anything running on your computer. This is started by the user or the shell.
- Job = a process that your shell (terminal) started and is tracking. This is started by the shell.
  
So:
- Every job is a process, because it‚Äôs something running.
- But not every process is a job, because some processes are started by the system or other programs, and your shell doesn‚Äôt know about them.
  
  `jobs` Lists all the jobs started in the current terminal session.
  
 ` ps` stands for process status. It shows you a snapshot of the processes running on your system.
  `ps -aux` lists running processes. Let‚Äôs break it down:
- `ps` ‚Üí process status (shows processes).
- `-a` ‚Üí all users‚Äô processes (not just yours).
- `-u` ‚Üí show the user/owner of each process.
- `-x `‚Üí include processes not attached to a terminal (like daemons).

  `ps -ef`
- `-e` ‚Üí show every process (system-wide, not just your shell).
- `-f` ‚Üí full-format, meaning you get extra details like parent PID, command arguments, etc.
Typical output:
```
UID   PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root    1     0  0 Sep21 ?        00:01:45 /sbin/init
user 2345  1234  1 10:03 pts/0    00:00:02 python app.py
```

- UID ‚Üí user owning the process
- PID ‚Üí process ID
- PPID ‚Üí parent process ID (who started it)
- C ‚Üí CPU utilization
- STIME ‚Üí start time of process
- TTY ‚Üí terminal associated (or ? if none)
- TIME ‚Üí total CPU time used
- CMD ‚Üí command/program that started the process

- `kill -9 PID` ‚Üí sends the SIGKILL signal to a process.This immediately forces the process to stop ‚Äî no cleanup, no chance to save data.
- `killall<process_name>` ‚Üí kills processes by name instead of PID.
- `kill -l` ‚Üí lists all available signals you can send to processes.So kill -l is basically your cheat sheet of signals.

Most common signals:
- 1 (SIGHUP) ‚Üí hangup (restart/reload a process, often used for daemons).
- 2 (SIGINT) ‚Üí interrupt (same as Ctrl+C).
- 9 (SIGKILL) ‚Üí force kill (immediate).
- 15 (SIGTERM) ‚Üí terminate gracefully (default for kill).
- 18 (SIGCONT) ‚Üí continue a stopped process.
- 19 (SIGSTOP) ‚Üí stop (pause) a process, can‚Äôt be ignored.
- 20 (SIGTSTP) ‚Üí stop from terminal (like Ctrl+Z).

### Parent and Child Processes
Every process in Linux is created by another process (except the very first one, init or systemd).

The process that creates another process is called the **parent process**(PPID).
The created process is called the **child process**.

Example:
```
bash (PPID=1000)
 ‚îú‚îÄ python script.py (PID=1234)
 ‚îî‚îÄ sleep 60 (PID=1235)
bash is the parent process.

python and sleep are child processes.
```
### Killing Processes
1. Killing a child process first
- Usually safe; parent may continue running.
- But sometimes the parent respawns the child automatically. \
Example: some service managers or scripts automatically restart child processes.

2. Killing the parent process first
- The parent stops, so it won‚Äôt restart or manage the child anymore.
- After that, killing child processes is final.
- 
### Why DevOps Engineers Care
- Many servers run services with parent-child hierarchies: web servers, worker processes, cron jobs.
- If you just kill the child process, it might come back automatically.
- Killing the parent first ensures clean shutdown of the whole process tree.
```
ps -ef | grep <process_name>
```
Columns: UID PID PPID CMD ‚Üí PPID = parent process ID.

Kill parent first, then child (if needed):
```
kill <PPID>
kill <PID>
```
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- `top` ‚Üí built-in Linux command to monitor processes, CPU, and memory in real time.
- `htop` ‚Üí advanced, interactive version of top with colors, scrolling, and easier controls.
### Why `top` and `htop` matter for DevOps
- On servers, processes can misbehave: a service might hang, or a script might eat 100% CPU.
- With top/htop, you can spot the culprit immediately.
- You can decide to restart a service, kill a runaway process, or optimize resource usage.

----------------------------------------------------------------
## Job
- `sleep 90` ‚Üí pauses execution for 90 seconds.
- You can run the` sleep `command in the background by adding `&` at the end

After you run something in the background (with &), you can bring it back to the foreground using:
`fg<job number>`
- If you have multiple background jobs, you can specify which one with the job number:
```
fg %1   # brings job 1 to foreground
fg %2   # brings job 2 to foreground
```

üëâ `jobs` will show you the job numbers `([1], [2], etc.).`

**Ctrl+Z** ‚Üí suspends (pauses) the current foreground job and puts it into the background in a stopped state.
`bg` ‚Üí resumes a job in the background instead of the foreground.
**Ctrl+C** - kills the bg process


To check the total memory your system has:
```
free -h
```

Output example:
```
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           8G         6G         1G         0.1G        1G          1.5G
Swap:          2G         0.5G       1.5G

```
- total ‚Üí how much RAM the system has
- used ‚Üí currently in use by processes
- free ‚Üí completely unused memory
- available ‚Üí memory available for new applications

### Free Up Memory on a Linux Server
- Check total memory ‚Üí `free -h`
- List running processes sorted by memory ‚Üí `ps aux --sort=-%mem` or` top `(press M)
- Identify unnecessary processes
- Stop unneeded processes ‚Üí` kill <PID> `or `killall <process_name>`
- Verify freed memory ‚Üí `free -h`

## As a devops engineer, why do I need to know about Jobs and processes
**Jobs and processes** are basically the heartbeat of a Linux server. If you don‚Äôt understand them, you can‚Äôt reliably manage, debug, or automate servers ‚Äî and that‚Äôs exactly what DevOps engineers do every day.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Managing running programs \
- On servers, multiple programs run simultaneously: web servers, databases, scripts, background tasks.
- You need to know which processes are running, how much resources they use, and how to stop or restart them.
- Example: a runaway process eating all CPU ‚Üí you need to find it and kill it.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging issues \
If something breaks on a server, you check processes to see:
- Is the service running? (ps, systemctl status)
- Did it crash?
- Is a background script still running?

3Ô∏è‚É£ Running tasks efficiently
- Some scripts or commands can run in foreground (blocking) or background (non-blocking).
- You might want to run nightly backups, monitoring scripts, or deployments in the background so the terminal stays free.
Commands you‚Äôll use a lot:
- jobs ‚Üí see background jobs
- fg ‚Üí bring a background job to foreground
- bg ‚Üí send a stopped job to background
- ps, top, htop ‚Üí monitor all processes
- kill, killall ‚Üí stop processes

4Ô∏è‚É£ Automating server tasks
- DevOps often involves scripts, cron jobs, and monitoring.
- You need to know how to start, stop, and monitor processes automatically.
- Example: if a critical service stops unexpectedly, you can detect it and restart it automatically.
