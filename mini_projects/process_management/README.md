Process & Job Management Challenge
Goal: Practice managing foreground and background jobs.
Tasks:
- Write a shell script that starts at least 2 different processes (e.g., sleep, tail).
- Show how to:
  - Run them in background,
  - Bring them back to foreground,
  - Kill them gracefully.
- Document commands used: jobs, fg, bg, kill, ps, top.
Deliverable: Script + a short guide (markdown or PDF) explaining the steps.
