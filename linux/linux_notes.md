The Linux file system is the structure Linux uses to organize and manage all files, with everything starting from the root /. It exists so data isnâ€™t just raw 1s and 0s but stored in an orderly, secure, and accessible way.

You need to know it because it helps you navigate the system, troubleshoot problems, manage permissions, and run services

Here are some of the of the linux files and their purpose:
- /bin= contains essential user commands
- /sbin= contains system admin commands
- /etc= configuration files like system configs and network files
- /home = home directories for users
- usr=user system resourses
- /var=Variable data. It contails files that change while the system is running
- /dev=device files like usb,keyboard,etc
- /mnt & /media= mont points for external drives
- /boot =Bootloader files

## Root user Vs Normal User
Normal user is is like an everyday account with limited permissions. Prompt in linux ends with $
Root user is the superuser in Linux and has full control over the system. Prompt in linux ends with #

Use sudo to temporarily become root for a command.
